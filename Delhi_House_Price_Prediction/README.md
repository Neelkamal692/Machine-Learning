# Delhi House Price Prediction 
This Project was an extension of the analysis i did during my internship at "AAP", where House prices of delhi were used as an affluency factor for some colonies in Delhi. Thereafter, i decide to build a model to see how accurately i can predict the prices of houses in Delhi   

There are three files in this directory.
1. Code to extract Data from MagicBick's website, which is not very efficient.
2. The extracted csv file of 1200 properties of well known localities of Delhi.
3. EDA and Price Prediction of Delhi houses with Linear regression and DecisionTree
