# Boston House Prediction 
# This is Boston House Price Prediction, dataset is available in sklearn libraray.
I have tried two approaches to solve the problem.
1. Linear regression using Normal Equation.
2. Linear Regression using scikit-learn.
conclusion : Sklearn internally uses Normal equation to solve regression problem.... check regression coeffiecients and intercepts
